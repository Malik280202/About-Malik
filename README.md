### Instructions:

1. **Create a New Text File**:
    - Inside your local copy of the repository, create a new file named `about_me.txt`.
    - In this file, write a brief introduction about yourself, your background, and why you're taking this course.

2. **Commit and Push your Changes to GitHub**:
    - Stage your new file for commit.
    - Commit the file with a meaningful message, such as "Added about_me.txt".
    - Push the committed changes back to your personal repository on GitHub.

**Tip**: Review your Git and Command Line cheat sheets if you're unsure about any step. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek assistance if needed. Remember, the process is just as important as the outcome!
